A very interesting talk about the reproducibility controversy that is rocking the scientific community. A “Nature” survey in 2016 showed that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.
To a certain extent, this could be a result of the reliance on the p-value as the test of statistical significance in scientific studies.</description>
