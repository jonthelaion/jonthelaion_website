A very interesting talk about the reproducibility controversy that is rocking the scientific community. A &amp;ldquo;Nature&amp;rdquo; survey in 2016 showed that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist&amp;rsquo;s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.
To a certain extent, this could be a result of the reliance on the p-value as the test of statistical significance in scientific studies.</description>
