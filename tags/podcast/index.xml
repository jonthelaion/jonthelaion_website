      <description>Data Framed is a great podcast at DataCamp hosted by Hugo Bowne-Anderson and can be found here. Each week, he invites working data scientists from various backgrounds onto his podcast to talk about their own experiences; how they got to where they are; and all other things data. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s inspiring to hear about all the great work that is being done in the industry and also comforting to know that others have often taken a meandering path by following their interests to get to where they are.</description>
