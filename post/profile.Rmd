I believe

* that beauty is more than skin deep
* that chivalry ainâ€™t dead
* that family is not just defined by blood
* that in the sky, there is no distinction of east or west
* that buddhism is more of a philosophy than a religion
* that pluto is a planet
* that cheez tv was the greatest show ever
* that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

# Purpose

To observe, capture and understand the complexities of life;  
Express these complexities in a manner that is elegant in its simplicity;  
Thereby creating environments which are genuine, inspiring and fun;  
And ultimately making the world a better place as a result of my actions.
