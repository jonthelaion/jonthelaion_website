I am creating this blog to journal my progress towards becoming ~~a data scientist~~ an applied statistician. While my interest was initially piqued by the data science hype train, I feel that after a year or so of dipping my toes into the resources available online, my view of this discipline is more closely aligned with the traditional school of applied statistics, rather than the newer "hacker-culture" school of data science.  

One major appeal of working in statistics / data science is that the skills gained are largely industry-agnostic and presents me with an opportunity to work in a variety of fields. Ultimately, I hope to be able to use modern statistical techniques and technologies to make a positive contribution to society in one or more of the following areas:

- education and learning analytics;
- mental health;
- aged care and the elderly;
- minorities and equality;
- crime and justice.
