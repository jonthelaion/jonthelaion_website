      <description>R Basics R has five basic/atomic classes of objects:
 character numeric (real numbers) integer complex logical (True/False)  R objects have attributes and can be accessed by using the attributes() function.
Numerics are generally treated as double precision real numbers.
Integers are obtained by specifying the L suffix (e.g. 1L).
There is also a special number Inf which represents infinity and NaN represents an undefined value.
Vectors Vectors can be created with either vector() or c().</description>

      <description>Introduction  Question should come first; data should come second Rarely will you have full, complete and clean data that you need to answer the question Statistics is the science of learning from data and is used wherever there is uncertainty What do data scientists do?  Define the question Define the ideal question set Determine what data you can access Obtain the data Clean the data Exploratory data analysis Statistical prediction/modeling Interpret results Challenge results Synthesize/write up results Create reproducible code Distribute results to other people  Key characteristics of &amp;ldquo;hackers&amp;rdquo;  Willing to find answers on their own Knowledgeable about where to find answers on their own Unintimidated by new data types or packages Unafraid to say they don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer In summary: Polite but relentless   Command Line Interface  CLI commands follow this recipe: command flags arguments pwd: prints working directory clear: clears CLI screen ls: lists all files in current directory  -a: lists both hidden and unhidden files -l: lists details of unhidden files al: lists details of both hidden and unhidden files  cd &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;: change directory to path  cd &amp;lt;blank&amp;gt;: go to home directory cd .</description>
