      <description>I created this blog to journal my progress towards becoming a data scientist an applied statistician. While my interest was initially piqued by the data science hype train, I feel that my interest in this discipline is probably more closely aligned with the traditional school of applied statistics, rather than the newer &amp;ldquo;hacker-culture&amp;rdquo; school of data science. I am as interested (if not more) in model interpretability and the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; behind the answers as much as I am in building accurate models.</description>
