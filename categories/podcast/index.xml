A very interesting talk about the reproducibility controversy that is rocking the scientific community. A “Nature” survey in 2016 showed that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.
To a certain extent, this could be a result of the reliance on the p-value as the test of statistical significance in scientific studies.</description>

      <description>Data Framed is a great podcast at DataCamp hosted by Hugo Bowne-Anderson and can be found here. Each week, he invites working data scientists from various backgrounds onto his podcast to talk about their own experiences; how they got to where they are; and all other things data. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s inspiring to hear about all the great work that is being done in the industry and also comforting to know that others have often taken a meandering path by following their interests to get to where they are.</description>
