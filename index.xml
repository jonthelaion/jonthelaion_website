      <description>R Basics R has five basic/atomic classes of objects:
 character numeric (real numbers) integer complex logical (True/False)  R objects have attributes and can be accessed by using the attributes() function.
Numerics are generally treated as double precision real numbers.
Integers are obtained by specifying the L suffix (e.g. 1L).
There is also a special number Inf which represents infinity and NaN represents an undefined value.
Vectors Vectors can be created with either vector() or c().</description>

Aesthetics Best Practices  Form follows function:  Consider whether the graph is for exploratory or explanatory purposes and who the audience is. The intention should never be about making your graph &amp;ldquo;pretty&amp;rdquo; or impressing the audience  For continuous variables:  Scatter plots are an effective means of communication Ensure that y-axes are aligned if they are being displayed side-by-side  For categorical variables:  Colour can be quite effective Remove unnecessary visual elements (e.</description>

      <description>Raw versus Processed Data  Raw data  The original source of the data Often hard to use for data analysis Data analysis includes processing Raw data may only need to be processed once  Processed data  Data that is ready for analysis Processing can include merging, subsetting, transforming, etc. There may be standards for processing All steps should be recorded.   The components of tidy data  The four things you should have:  The raw data The tidy data set A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set (a.</description>

      <description>Introduction  Question should come first; data should come second Rarely will you have full, complete and clean data that you need to answer the question Statistics is the science of learning from data and is used wherever there is uncertainty What do data scientists do?  Define the question Define the ideal question set Determine what data you can access Obtain the data Clean the data Exploratory data analysis Statistical prediction/modeling Interpret results Challenge results Synthesize/write up results Create reproducible code Distribute results to other people  Key characteristics of &amp;ldquo;hackers&amp;rdquo;  Willing to find answers on their own Knowledgeable about where to find answers on their own Unintimidated by new data types or packages Unafraid to say they don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer In summary: Polite but relentless   Command Line Interface  CLI commands follow this recipe: command flags arguments pwd: prints working directory clear: clears CLI screen ls: lists all files in current directory  -a: lists both hidden and unhidden files -l: lists details of unhidden files al: lists details of both hidden and unhidden files  cd &amp;lt;path&amp;gt;: change directory to path  cd &amp;lt;blank&amp;gt;: go to home directory cd .</description>

      <description>HBR - If your data is bad your machine learning tools are useless  Link: https://hbr.org/2018/04/if-your-data-is-bad-your-machine-learning-tools-are-useless &amp;ldquo;Garbage-in garbage-out&amp;rdquo; adage is equally applicable to machine learning. The quality demands of machine learning are steep - both at the training stage and when using the model in production. To properly train a predictive model, historical data must meet exceptionally broad and high quality standards:  The data must be correct, properly labelled, deduped etc.</description>

      <description>Data Framed is a great podcast at DataCamp hosted by Hugo Bowne-Anderson and can be found here. Each week, he invites working data scientists from various backgrounds onto his podcast to talk about their own experiences; how they got to where they are; and all other things data. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s inspiring to hear about all the great work that is being done in the industry and also comforting to know that others have often taken a meandering path by following their interests to get to where they are.</description>

      <description>With years of experience in both academia and industry, authors Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil &amp;amp; Rachel Schutt look beyond the hype to explore what the data science discipline entails and looks like in practice.
They also explore an idea that is often overlooked when speaking about data science - that building models and working with data is not value-neutral. You choose the problems you will work on, you make assumptions in those models, you choose metrics, and you design the algorithms.</description>

      <description>I am creating this blog to journal my progress towards becoming a data scientist an applied statistician. While my interest was initially piqued by the data science hype train, I feel that after a year or so of dipping my toes into the resources available online, my view of this discipline is more closely aligned with the traditional school of applied statistics, rather than the newer “hacker-culture” school of data science.</description>
